  * In the current era, the rate of crimes is increasing day by day which is leading to difficulty in managing enormous number of cases.<br/><br/>
  * Various kinds of problems are faced today like<br/><br/>
    * control room emergency numbers remain engaged.<br/><br/>
    * For getting information about our case details we have specifically visit police station.<br/><br/>
    * Moreover managing information about case for the cop is quite difficult.<br/><br/>
  *  For all these problems, we came with the idea of Devcops, through which<br/><br/>
    * public can register their complaints, check status of it on the mobile only and send enquiries about the case.<br/><br/>
    * On the cop side, information can be updated about case in realtime.<br/><br/>
    * Additionally, by this app cops can create sketch of the culprit at any time for which earlier they needed to head back the station and using special tools.
